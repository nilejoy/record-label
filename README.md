## This project was created without having DDL in mind!

- A DDL and DML dedicated project can be found on my repositories page titled [shop](https://github.com/nilejoy/shop);
- This is extended SQL code using the procedural extension of MySQL on an [already existing database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database/releases/tag/v1.4.0);
- The aim of this project is to highlight its creator's skills in using the procedural extension of MySQL;
- This code will also be adapted for both the T-SQL and the PL/SQL extensions some time in the future.
